%%---------------------------------  INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}
This document contains the   testing for the Resolve Cafeteria Management System that will be created for Software Engineering (COS 301) at the University of Pretoria 2015, by the group T-RISE. In this document we will thoroughly discuss and layout the project's testing to provide a clear view of the system as a whole. An agile approach is being followed which involves an interactive and incremential method of managing and designing the system. 

%% ------------------------------ VISION ------------------------------------------------------
\section{Vision}
The vision of this project is to implement a flexible, pluggable, fully functional software application that will be maintainable, with detailed supporting documentation and an instruction manual for the Cafeteria Management System. This system will assist in managing the cafeteria's inventory/stock, executing orders from the cafeteria, generating bills and sending these to the appropriate parties and facilitating payments for access cards (or the use of unique access card numbers). 

%%---------------------------------- BACKGROUND -----------------------------------------
\section{Background}
As specified in the project proposal document from Resolve - the cafeteria is currently cash only and does not accept bank cards or electronic payments. This makes it inconvenient for employees as they have to carry around cash if they want to purchase anything from the cafeteria. Hence, this is equivalent to purchasing from an external food outlet where they can also pay with their preferred method of payment. The employees have to hence use up fuel and time and lastly this does not bring in the maximum amount of income to the cafeteria, hindering its growth and improvement.\\

Resolve is therefore looking for a means to accept payments from employees for the canteen using their employee access cards or access card numbers, with an amount being deducted from their salary at the end of the month.\\

Resolve proposed the Cafeteria Management System to assist with this problem.
After our first meeting with the client, they brought to our attention that at times the cafeteria does not even have enough stock to provide some of the menu items, thus the managing of inventory or stock will also be part of the system. The system will also predict what inventory/stock needs to be bought for the next week in order to avoid such a problem. At the end of each month, the bill for the month will be sent to either payroll or to the employee. This option is configurable from the user's profile. The employee can also set a spending limit for each month for control purposes. The system will have its own maximum, such that users cannot set a limit that exeeds this. 


%%-------------TESTING--------------------------------------
\section{Test Plan}

\subsection{Introduction}
The scope of the testing: This document will be used be the Team t-rise to elaborate and substantiate the unit tests conducted for the various use cases/ modules of the Resolve Cafeteria Management System. Unit tests using mocks and Integration tests using actual data from the system have been conducted and will be explained in the document below. Tests for the server side functionality as well as the client side functionality were executed.

\subsection{Technologies used for testing}
Testing was done during the construction of the various functions to ensure that the code is working at all times, and that only fully working functions are used in other functions going forward. PhantomJS was used to run the Mocha, Karma and Jasmine tests automatically, hence the tests for the different files could be run consecutively without being manually executed seperately. The reason the testing frameworks were used was due to the simple set up that it required and due to its compatibility with PhantomJs. In addition the syntax of these was simple and intuitive.  Karma in particular is the official Angular Js test runner, hence it was used. Mocha, is based on node.js and hence was used for this reason. 
\\
\subsection{How to run the unit tests}
To execute the tests one must first ensure that the Mongo database is running. After this, one opens a seperate terminal inside the Cafeteria Management System. Then sudo npm tes is run which executes PhantomJs to run the tests automatically.  The output will indicate whether the tests are passing or failing as well as the different descriptions for each test. Server side and client side tests are executed.

\subsection{Testing approach - Client Side}
The unit tests written for the Authentication module were done to test the functions inside authentication.client.controller.js and the superuser.client.controller.js file.  The register/ sign up functionality also resides in the authentication.client.controller.js file. The unit tests written for the Manage Profile module were done to test the settings.client.controller.js and the password.client.controller.js files, which contained the code to implement the manage profile module.
 
The functions tested for the Authentication module include signin() and signup(), located in the authentication.client.controller.js file, assignRoles(), setSystemWideLimit(), and setCanteenName() located in the  superuser.client.controller.js file.
 
The functions changeUserPassword() from the settings.client.controller.js and askForPasswordReset() from password.client.controller.js were tested. resetUserPassword() was not tested due to the fact that each time a user clicks Forgot Password, an email is sent to the user 
 
\subsection{Testing approach - Server Side}
The various functions from each module were tested on the server side, using the save() function to test if the items were able to be saved on the database. For the unit tests, mock objects were created, storing data under the different table column headings.
\\
The pre and post conditions, test cases and the result of the tests will now be discussed.
