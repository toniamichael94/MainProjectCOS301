# Resolve Cafeteria Management System
##COS 301 - Main Project 2015
 
As specified in the project proposal document from Resolve - the cafeteria is currently cash only and does not accept bank cards or electronic payments. This makes it inconvenient for employees as they have to carry around cash if they want to purchase anything from the cafeteria. Hence, this is equivalent to purchasing from an external food outlet where they can also pay with their preferred method of payment. The employees have to hence use up fuel and time and lastly this does not bring in the maximum amount of income to the cafeteria, hindering its growth and improvement.

Resolve is therefore looking for a means to accept payments from employees for the canteen using their employee access cards or access card numbers, with an amount being deducted from their salary at the end of the month.

Resolve proposed the Cafeteria Management System to assist with this problem. After our first meeting with the client, they brought to our attention that at times the cafeteria does not even have enough stock to provide some of the menu items, thus the managing of inventory or stock will also be part of the system. The system will also predict what inventory/stock needs to be bought for the next week in order to avoid such a problem. At the end of each month, the bill for the month will be sent to either payroll or to the employee. This option is configurable from the user's profile. The employee can also set a spending limit for each month for control purposes. The system will have its own maximum, such that users cannot set a limit that exeeds this. 

For more information, please have a look at the project proposal document in the root folder named resolve_cafeteriaManagementSystem.pdf.

- The first page that displays will be the order page. Here you can view the menu i.e. the menu items, the prices and the configurable daily specials. You will be able to select meal items here to purchase.

- If you hasn't logged on, the system will prompt you to log on in order to facilitate the order of the meal items.

- If you do not exist on the system, you will be prompted to register on the system and then log in.

- Once you have been logged in (using your Resolve employee number as a username), the system will check the total price of the meal items against your configurable spending limit to ensure that this limit is not exeeded.

- The system will also verify that the items that you have selected are in stock. 

- The system will then process your order

- You will recieve a notification when your meal is ready. You can configure if this is an email or sms

- You can go to your profile page to view account history and change various settings

- The cafeteria manager will be responsible for adding and removing stock items from the systems, to represent the current state of the cafeteria
