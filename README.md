# Resolve Cafeteria Management System
##COS 301 - Main Project 2015

This Project will be in short about creating a solution/system must assists in the collection of payments for the cafeteria not
the management of cafeteria staff and inventory or stock. The solution/system must facilitate payments from access cards
and ordering. The system must still allow the current process to exist as is or work in combination with it.

For more information, please have a look at the project proposal document in the root folder named resolve_cafeteriaManagementSystem.pdf.
