%%---------------------------------  INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}
This document contains the functional requirements specification, architecture requirements and testing for the Resolve Cafeteria Management System that will be created for Software Engineering (COS 301) at the University of Pretoria 2015, by the group T-RISE. In this document we will thoroughly discuss and layout the project's functional requirements to provide a clear view of the system as a whole. An agile approach is being followed which involves an interactive and incremental method of managing and designing the system as described by the scrum methodology.
%% ------------------------------ VISION ------------------------------------------------------
\section{Vision}
The vision of this project is to implement a flexible, pluggable, fully functional software application that will be maintainable, with detailed supporting documentation and an instruction manual for the Cafeteria Management System. This system will assist in managing the cafeteria's inventory/stock, placing orders made by employees, generating bills, and sending the appropriate information to the right parties.  

%%---------------------------------- BACKGROUND -----------------------------------------
\section{Background} 
\subsection{The current situation/ problems the client currently experience}
As specified in the project proposal document from Resolve, the cafeteria is currently cash only and does not accept bank cards or electronic payments. This isinconvenient for employees as they have to carry around cash if they want to purchase anything from the cafeteria. Employees may choose to go to an external food outlet where they can pay with their preferred method of payment, which uses time and fuel. Thus, this means the cafeteria does not achieve the maximum amount of income which hinders its growth and improvement.\\ A problem with the cafeteria itself is that certain meal items are hardly in stock due to either lack of ingredients to make the meal or under estimating the quantity of the meal item required.

\subsection{How the aforementioned problems will be alleviated by the CMS}
The Cafeteria Management System will provide a means to accept payments from employees, at the canteen, using their employee access cards or access card numbers, with an amount being deducted from their salary at the end of the month.  The option of cash payments ,however, will not be discarded. At the end of each month, the bill for the month will be sent to either payroll, to the employee, or to both. This option is thus configurable from the user's profile. The employee can also set a spending limit for each month. There will also be a system wide limit that users cannot exceed.
\\
The system will predict which inventory items needs to be bought for the next week in order to avoid the "out of stock" situation described above. The system will also enforce that the cafeteria manager 
\\
%%--------------------------------------- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS--------------------------------
\section{Functional Requirements and Application Design}
In this section we will discuss the functional requirements. \\

%% ---------------USE CASES -------------------
\subsection{Use Cases }
Below is a list of all the use cases we have identified:

\begin{itemize}

\item Authentication
\item Manage System
\item Manage Profile
\item Place Order
\item Manage Cafeteria
\item Manage Inventory 
\item Reporting

\end{itemize}


%% ------------------- USE CASE PRIORITIZATION -----------------------
\subsection{Use Case Prioritization}
Below the use cases mentioned above will be categorized as critical, important or nice to have.

\begin{itemize}

%%-----CRITICAL-----
\subsubsection{Critical}
\item \textbf{Authentication} \\
This is a critical use case due to the fact that you cannot send through any order if you are not logged in. In such a case you will only be able to view the menu. In addition, you can not log into the system if you have not been registered on the system.

\item \textbf{Place Order}\\
This is critical due to the fact that the main functionality of the system revolves around the ability to place orders at the cafeteria as well as other functionality that is closely related to the placing order functionality.

\item \textbf{Manage Inventory} \\
This use case is considered critical because it deals with adding, removing, searching for and updating (i.e. incrementing stock that has been added and decrementing stock when it is purchased or expired). This is hence vital for achieving the purpose of the system. The items displayed on the menu will contain a field called "Not in stock" if there is not a sufficient supply of inventory for the various menu items and the option to order an 'out of stock' item will not be available. 

\item \textbf{Manage Cafeteria} \\
This use case is considered critical because it deals with firstly adding menu items to the menu that the user will view, which again is vital for achieving the purpose of the system, as well as removing, updating and searching for various menu items. 

%%-----IMPORTANT-----
\subsubsection{Important}
\item \textbf{Manage Profile} \\
This use case is considered important because the user must be able edit their profile by resetting their personal spending limits and changing their email and passwords. The user must also be able to view his/her account history and current bill as well as his/her available balance for credit spending for the month. It is crucial that the user is able to configure spending limits according to their own preferences as well as keep track of monthly purchases.

\item \textbf{ Manage System} \\
This use case is considered important because this is where the super user will configure the maximum spending limit, assign roles such as a cashier, change employee IDs as well as branding functionality such as setting the canteen name and uploading a canteen photo for the home page.


\item \textbf{Reporting} \\
This use case is considered important because the system can still function without it but it is needed to meet the requirements. It deals with checking how much a user spent in a particular period of time and how much the user needs to pay back and has paid back. This is where the finance person can check who owes how much to the cafeteria or who has spent how much in a given time frame. 

\end{itemize}

%%--------------- USE CASE/SERVICE CONTRACTS --------------
%%------MODULAR SYSTEM------
\section{Modular System}

The system will be built using a modular approach to allow more modules to be added at a later stage. This will also provide for pluggability and integrability of the system.

\subsection{High level use case diagram of the CMS}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../images/CMSUseCase.png}
    \caption{Cafeteria Management System Use Case}
