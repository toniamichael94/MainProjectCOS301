\section{The Team}

\subsection{Antonia Michael}
**************PHOTO GOES HERE

\subsubsection{Interests}
My interests include working with people, helping people, reading, tennis, greek dancing. 
\subsubsection{Technical Skills}
My technical skills include: Java, C++, Html5, css, php, Bootstrap, Javascript, Semantic UI, Sql, php, python,  WebGL, Latex, Github, shell script, AngularJS, NodeJS, Microsoft Office, Npm, HandleBars Server, Mongoose, Gemfury. 
\subsubsection{Past experiences relevant for project}
Programming \\
I have done an internship at a small IT company called Lepsta (Pty)Ltd, where I worked mainly on the front end of their new systems. I was mainly responsible to implement the gui and front end functionality of their email client app called Ridicle, using AngularJS, Python, Semantic UI, and using Brackets as the platform.
I also assisted in implementing a CMS Website for small enterprise, NCC Solutions. In addition, for COS 301 I was chosen to be part of the Infrastructure Integration team to integrate the code given to us from the functional teams. We used NodeJS, RoboMongo, Mongoose, Nodemailer, Npm, Gemfury and HandleBars server for our integration. \\

Business Analysis \\
I also worked as a business analyst at Lepsta (Pty)Ltd, where my duties included firstly, requirements management - gathering, defining, analyzing and documenting business and functional requirements and designing a solution based on these requirements. Secondly, communicating requirements to programmers and other stakeholders ensuring that everyone understands what is required for the project to be a success. I also had to develop the business processes to provide a graphical flow of data, indicating the relationship between stakeholders and systems. I had to also design the test cases and implement the testing. Throughout the process I served as a communication channel, ensuring that all the teams knew exactly what was expected of them, and reported their progress and any concerns to me.
\\
Project Management \\
At Lepsta (Pty)Ltd I also worked as a Project Manager. I developed a schedule for the project completion, allocating resources to the tasks. I also had to determine resources needed to complete the different phases of the project (i.e. time, money, technologies). I used a Gannt chart to allocate time frames for the different tasks in the project. I used a SCRUM board to keep track of the progress of the different tasks and to let the project needs see a visual representation of their tasks at hand. I had to keep regular communication with management to express the programmers' concerns and progress. It was also my job to develop team spirit and make sure that each member is contributing equally to the projects. \\

Was then selected by UP to present research paper at the 2014 Information Ethics Conference held at The University of Zululand, competing with students from UJ, UP and other universities. We obrained 2nd place.
