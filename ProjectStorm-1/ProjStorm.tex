\subsubsection{Interests}
My interests include working with people, helping people, reading, tennis, greek dancing. 
\subsubsection{Technical Skills}
My technical skills include: Java, C++, Html5, css, php, Bootstrap, Javascript, Semantic UI, Sql, php, python,  WebGL, Latex, Github, shell script, AngularJS, NodeJS, Microsoft Office, Npm, HandleBars Server, Mongoose, Gemfury and mocha unit testing. 
\subsubsection{Past experiences relevant for project}
Programming \\
I have done an internship at a small IT company called Lepsta (Pty)Ltd, where I worked mainly on the front end of their new systems. I was mainly responsible to implement the gui and front end functionality of their email client app called Ridicle, using AngularJS, Python, Semantic UI, and using Brackets as the platform.
I also assisted in implementing a CMS Website for small enterprise, NCC Solutions. In addition, for COS 301 I was chosen to be part of the Infrastructure Integration team to integrate the code given to us from the functional teams. We used NodeJS, RoboMongo, Mongoose, Nodemailer, Npm, Gemfury and HandleBars server for our integration. \\

Business Analysis \\
I also worked as a business analyst at Lepsta (Pty)Ltd, where my duties included firstly, requirements management - gathering, defining, analyzing and documenting business and functional requirements and designing a solution based on these requirements. Secondly, communicating requirements to programmers and other stakeholders ensuring that everyone understands what is required for the project to be a success. I also had to develop the business processes to provide a graphical flow of data, indicating the relationship between stakeholders and systems. I had to also design the test cases and implement the testing. Throughout the process I served as a communication channel, ensuring that all the teams knew exactly what was expected of them, and reported their progress and any concerns to me.
\\
Project Management \\
At Lepsta (Pty)Ltd I also worked as a Project Manager. I developed a schedule for the project completion, allocating resources to the tasks. I also had to determine resources needed to complete the different phases of the project (i.e. time, money, technologies). I used a Gannt chart to allocate time frames for the different tasks in the project. I used a SCRUM board to keep track of the progress of the different tasks and to let the project needs see a visual representation of their tasks at hand. I had to keep regular communication with management to express the programmers' concerns and progress. It was also my job to develop team spirit and make sure that each member is contributing equally to the projects. \\
 
\subsubsection{Non technical strengths}
My non technical strengths include: \\

Leadership skills - 
 \\1.) Head of Communications in The School of IT faculty House
 \\2.) Selected by the Department of Computer Science to be a 	Infrastructure Team Leader for the module COS 301 for the implementation of The Buzz System, 
 \\3.) Was a class Representative for the module, Imperative Programming.
   
Public speaking and presentation skills - Got chosen as the best overall paper and presentation from our presentation at the 2014 ACEIE Information Science Conference held at The University of Pretoria. Was then selected by UP to present research paper at the 2014 Information Ethics Conference held at The University of Zululand, competing with students from UJ, UP and other universities. We obrained 2nd place. 
\\
Social responsibility skills - Tutored for the Basic Computer Training course (6 sessions) for underprivileged female students eager to persue IT careers.\\ 
Organised and ran a Computer Training course for members of the community at UP Mamelodi Campus with a group of 4 other students - 40 hours of community work for JCP community development module in second year \\

Debutantes Year at school (2010) â€“ Hosted various events/ programmes to raise funds for the Phehela Day and Night Centre and assisted with other similar charities.\\,

Teaching skills - In addition, the computer literacy courses I have taught, I am currently a Tutor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Pretoria.
Other skills: 
Communication skills, team work skills and people skills.

\subsubsection{Interests}

My interests are playing sudoku, cards, cooking, reading, shopping and spending time with friends and family.

\subsubsection{Technical Skills}

My technical skills include: C++, Java, CSS, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, NodeJS, nodeunit, Mongoose, WebGL, Microsoft Office, SQL and XML.
 
\subsubsection{Past experiences relevant for project}

I have successfully completed COS 216 (Netcentric Computer Systems)  which taught me a the required web development skills required for this project. I also believe that all the other programming modules I have done in the past two and a half years will help me and my team complete this project successfully.

\subsubsection{Non technical strengths}

My non technical strengths include: 

Team work and communication skills - The Software Engineering course offered us a mini project at the beginning of the year where we had to work in multiple different teams with different kinds of people. This gave me the opportunity to learn to work in a team setting and to communicate appropriately.
 
Public speaking and presentation skills - I participated in public speaking in 2011 and 2012. This taught me not only good speech writing but valuable presentation skills.
I also took part in a computer training course at the UP Mamelodi Campus in 2014 - this gave me the opportunity to better my public speaking and presentation skills.

Social responsibility skills - I tutored a Basic Computer Training course (6 sessions) for underprivileged female students.
I organised and ran a Computer Training course for members of the community at UP Mamelodi Campus with a group of 4 other students - 40 hours of community work for JCP community development module in second year.

\subsubsection{What makes you want to do the project}

The project sounds interesting and challenging. It is something that we will be proud of at the end of the year after having completed it.

\subsubsection{Interests}
During my past two years of studying Computer Science, I have developed a
passion for software development. Finding creative solutions to problems in
the form of software is something that denitely falls in my interests. I am
also fond of the outdoors, helping others and baking

\subsubsection{Technical Skills}
My thecnical skills include: C++, Java, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, XML, HTML,
SQL, WebGL, Micrisoft Office and NodeJS.

\subsubsection{Past experiences relevant for project}
I have successfully completed my foundational programming modules and
more specialized modules at the University of Pretoria, thus I am capable
of producing adequate and usable software. I also participated in the mini-
project of COS 301, which made use of the principles which will be used in
Project Storm, which will help with the understanding of the project.

\subsubsection{None technical strengths}
I believe I am a good team player, with that I mean that I am a supportive
person when it comes to team work, I respect my other team members and
I am good in sharing my ideas and listening to other's ideas. I can take on
a leadership position if need be, such as the position I was placed in for the
mini-project of COS 301 as a middle level team lead.

\subsubsection{What makes you want to do the project}
My previous experience with the mini-project in COS 301 is my motivation to do Project Storm. During the mini-project we were asked after each phase to fill in questions to gather information for 'Rocking the boat' and that got me thinking on how things work behind the scenes, how are group members sorted and so forth. Thus it would be interesting for me to be able to assist in the development of the software of how students are divided behind the scenes into groups according to their evaluation and personalities.
