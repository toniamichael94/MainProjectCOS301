%%---------------------------------  INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}
This Document contains the Functional Requirements Specification for the Resolve Cafeteria Management System that will be created for Software Engineering 301 at the University of Pretoria 2015, by the group T-RISE. In this document we will thoroughly discuss and layout the project's architecture requirements , functional requirements and application design to give a clear view of the system as a whole . 

%% ------------------------------ VISION ------------------------------------------------------
\section{Vision}
The vision of this project is to fully implement a flexible, pluggable, fully functional software application that will be maintainable, with detailed supporting documentation and an instruction manual for the Cafeteria Management System. This system will then assist in the collection of payments for the cafeteria, manage inventory/stock, facilitate payments for access cards (or the use of unique access card numbers) and facilitate ordering from the cafeteria. The system will still allow the cafeteria to use the system they are using currently as it is with combination of a user friendly application and online facility to place orders and check stock and make predictions of needed stock for the following week.

%%---------------------------------- BACKGROUND -----------------------------------------
\section{Background}
As specified in the tender proposal document from Resolve - the cafeteria is currently cash only and does not accept bank cards or electronic payments. This makes it difficult for employees as they have to carry cash. In this case the employee might as well go to an outside food provider and
pay with their preferred method of payment. This problem wastes fuel for the employees, time for the company and does not bring in the maximum amount of income to the cafeteria, hindering its growth and improvement.\\

Resolve is looking for a way to accept payments from employees for the canteen
using their employee access cards, with an amount being deducted from their salary at the end of the month.\\

Resolve Proposed the Cafeteria Management System to assist with this problem.
At our first meeting with Resolve, they have also brought under our attention that at times the cafeteria does not have enough stock to make some of the menu items, and thus the reporting of inventory or stock will also be part of this solution system containing predictions on what inventory/stock needs to be bought for the next week.
